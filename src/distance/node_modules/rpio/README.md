node-rpio
=========

This is a node.js add-on which wraps around Mike McCauley's
[bcm2835](http://www.open.com.au/mikem/bcm2835/) library to allow `mmap`
access via `/dev/mem` to the GPIO pins.

If you want something more featureful then for now you should check out James
Barwell's [rpio-gpio.js](https://github.com/JamesBarwell/rpi-gpio.js).  The
reason for me writing this module instead of using James' is that his uses the
`/sys` interface which is too slow for my requirements.

## Install

Easily install the latest via npm:

```bash
$ npm install rpio
```

## API

```js
var rpio = require('rpio')

// Enable a pin and mark as read-only
rpio.setInput(11)

// Enable a pin and mark as read-write
rpio.setOutput(12)

// Read value of pin
console.log('pin 11 is set to ' + rpio.read(11))

// Set pin high (i.e. write '1' to it)
rpio.write(12, rpio.HIGH)
```

## Simple demo

```js
/*
 * Simple demo to flash pin 11 at 100Hz (assuming it's routed to an LED).
 */
var rpio = require('rpio')

// Set the pin for write mode
rpio.setOutput(11)

// Set the pin high every 10ms
setInterval(function() {
  rpio.write(11, rpio.HIGH)
}, 10)

// Set the pin low every 10ms, offset by 5ms.
setTimeout(function() {
  setInterval(function() {
    rpio.write(11, rpio.LOW)
  }, 5)
}, 10)
```
